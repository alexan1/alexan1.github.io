What is esim?

From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card#Embedded-SIM):

> An embedded-SIM (eSIM) or embedded universal integrated circuit card (eUICC) is a form of programmable SIM that is embedded directly into a device.

Esim is used [in iPhone, iPad and Pixel](https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/134640-what-is-an-esim-and-how-will-it-change-connected-devices-for-the-better).

These phones usually have one slot for physical sim and other esim, so you can have two phones numbers on one device (something like dual sim phones).
