What is esim?

From [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card#Embedded-SIM):

> An embedded-SIM (eSIM) or embedded universal integrated circuit card (eUICC) is a form of programmable SIM that is embedded directly into a device.

Esim is used [in iPhone, iPad and Pixel](https://www.pocket-lint.com/phones/news/134640-what-is-an-esim-and-how-will-it-change-connected-devices-for-the-better).

These phones usually have one slot for physical sim and other esim, so you can have two phones numbers on the one device (something like dual sim phones).

Difference between dual sim phone and phone with esim, that in former case you have two numbers at the same time, but in latter you should select current carrier, so you can use only one number at the current time.

Btw, esim can be used not only in phones, but in other devices, which requre access to cellular data, but here we aren't look at this.

To use esim in phone we need to get esim pack from your phone provider. It can be in form of QR code.

Unfortunately not all phone providers support esim at this moment.

But Google added esim in their Pixel phones to allow users to subscibe to [Google Fi](https://fi.google.com) service.

What is [Google Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Fi):
