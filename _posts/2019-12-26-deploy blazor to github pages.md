There are two [hosting models for Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/hosting-models?view=aspnetcore-3.1):
1. Blazor Server
2. Blazor WebAssembly

Latest is client side model, so it can be hosted as static website, for example in [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website), [FireBase](https://firebase.google.com/) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
