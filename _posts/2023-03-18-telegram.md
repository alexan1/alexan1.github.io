---

We have a lot of different messaging services, which we can use on our mobile or descktop platform, for example:
1. [skype](https://www.skype.com/)
2. [whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com/)
3. [viber](https://www.viber.com/)
4. [signal](https://signal.org/)
5. [google chat](https://chat.google.com/)
6. [telegram](https://telegram.org/)

and may others app.

But why do you need telegram if you have a such variety of services?

Lets ask [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). This is his answer:

<Telegram is a messaging app that offers a unique set of features that sets it apart from other communication services. Here are some reasons why you may want to consider using Telegram:

Security and Privacy: Telegram offers end-to-end encryption, which means that your messages are secure and can only be read by the intended recipient. Additionally, Telegram has a feature called "Secret Chats" which are fully encrypted and not stored on Telegram's servers.

Large File Transfers: Telegram allows users to send large files up to 2GB in size, which is much larger than what most other messaging apps allow.

Customization: Telegram allows users to customize the app in many ways, such as creating custom themes, using custom fonts, and even creating custom stickers.

Group Chats: Telegram allows users to create groups with up to 200,000 members, which is much larger than what most other messaging apps allow.

Cross-Platform Support: Telegram can be used on multiple devices and platforms, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, and your messages are synced across all devices.

Overall, if you prioritize security, privacy, large file transfers, customization, group chats, and cross-platform support, Telegram may be a great communication service for you. However, if these features are not important to you, other communication services may be a better fit.>
