title: what is the telegram and why we should use it
---

We have a lot of different messaging services, which we can use on our mobile or descktop platform, for example:
1. [skype](https://www.skype.com/)
2. [whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com/)
3. [viber](https://www.viber.com/)
4. [signal](https://signal.org/)
5. [google chat](https://chat.google.com/)
6. [telegram](https://telegram.org/)

and may others app.

But why do you need telegram if you have a such variety of services?
