title: what is Telegram and why should we use it
---

We have a lot of different messaging services, which we can use on our mobile or desktop platform, for example:
1. [skype](https://www.skype.com/)
2. [whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com/)
3. [viber](https://www.viber.com/)
4. [signal](https://signal.org/)
5. [google chat](https://chat.google.com/)
6. [telegram](https://telegram.org/)

and may others app.

But why do you need telegram if you have a such variety of services?

Lets ask [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/). This is its answer:

>Telegram is a messaging app that offers a unique set of features that sets it apart from other communication services. Here are some reasons why you may want to consider using Telegram:
>
>1. Security and Privacy: Telegram offers end-to-end encryption, which means that your messages are secure and can only be read by the intended recipient. Additionally, Telegram has a feature called "Secret Chats" which are fully encrypted and not stored on Telegram's servers.
>
>2. Large File Transfers: Telegram allows users to send large files up to 2GB in size, which is much larger than what most other messaging apps allow.
>
>3. Customization: Telegram allows users to customize the app in many ways, such as creating custom themes, using custom fonts, and even creating custom stickers.
>
>4. Group Chats: Telegram allows users to create groups with up to 200,000 members, which is much larger than what most other messaging apps allow.
>
>5. Cross-Platform Support: Telegram can be used on multiple devices and platforms, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, and your messages are synced across all devices.
>
>Overall, if you prioritize security, privacy, large file transfers, customization, group chats, and cross-platform support, Telegram may be a great communication service for you. However, if these features are not important to you, other communication services may be a better fit.

But what is the most great telegram feature, it's telegram channels:

>Telegram channels are a unique feature of the messaging app that allow individuals or organizations to broadcast messages to a large number of subscribers. Here are some things to know about Telegram channels:
>
>1. Public vs. Private Channels: Telegram channels can be either public or private. Public channels are open to anyone who wants to join, while private channels require an invitation from the channel owner.
>
>2. Unlimited Subscribers: Telegram channels can have an unlimited number of subscribers, which makes them a powerful tool for organizations or individuals who want to reach a large audience.
>
>3. Broadcast-Only: Unlike Telegram groups, which allow members to interact with each other, Telegram channels are broadcast-only, meaning that only the channel owner can post messages.
>
>4. Customizable: Channel owners can customize their channels by adding a profile picture and description, as well as by changing the channel's name and link.
>
>5. Niche Content: Telegram channels cover a wide range of topics, from news and politics to entertainment and technology. Many channels are dedicated to niche topics, such as cryptocurrency, travel, or fitness.
>
>Overall, Telegram channels can be a great way to stay informed about your interests and get updates from your favorite organizations or individuals. If you're interested in starting your own channel, it can be a powerful tool for reaching a large audience and sharing your message.

I'm getting a lot of a messages from recruiters, which I want to share with my friends and other people who are looking for a job.

So I created [job IT channel](https://t.me/job_it_recruit) and [job IT group chat](https://t.me/jobs_it_recruit).

I invite everybody to [subscribe to my channel](https://t.me/+4xNYrUBGmNZiMDRh).

It can be useful for recruiters and job seekers.
