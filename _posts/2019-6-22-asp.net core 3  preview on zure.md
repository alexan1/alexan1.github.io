title: publish asp.net core 3 preview on azure
---

[ASP.NET Core 3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0-preview-6/) is still preview.

If you try to deploy it to [Azure App Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/app-service/) it won't work.

But you can do it using the following 2 options:

1. [Install the preview site extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/azure-apps/index?view=aspnetcore-3.0#install-the-preview-site-extension)
2. [Deploy the app self-contained](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/azure-apps/index?view=aspnetcore-3.0#deploy-the-app-self-contained)

I did both and [it works](https://aspnetcore3m.azurewebsites.net/).
