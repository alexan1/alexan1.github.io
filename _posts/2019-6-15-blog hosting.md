Now it's popular to use static site generators, see for example Scott Hanselman's article: [Exploring Wyam - a .NET Static Site Content Generator](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/HeadlessCMSAndDecoupledCMSInNETCore.aspx):

>It's a bit of a renaissance out there when it comes to Static Site Generators. There's Jekyll and GitBook, Hugo and Hexo. Middleman and >Pelican, Brunch and Octopress. There's dozens, if not hundreds of static site content generators, and "long tail is long."

And of course it's true for blogs. One way for this - use [Github Pages As Blogging Platform](https://medium.com/@tordable/github-pages-as-blogging-platform-320524b1fffa).
You can use [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll) as content generator.
