title: custom email for domain hosted on github page
---

When you host your domain as GitHub page, GitHub doesn't give you option to host your domain email.

Which options you have:

1. If you bought you name on godaddy you can host email there (but only one).
2. Godaddy allows you to forward 100 email
3. If you have [Google Apps](https://gsuite.google.com/) account, you can host email there
...Unfortunately Google doesn't allow subscription to free tier of Google Apps, but if you subscribed before you can keep it.
