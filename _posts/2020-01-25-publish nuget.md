I developed library for my project. Then I thought: why don't publish it on?

It's very simple actually. Just followed [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/publish-a-package): packed project from visual studio and upload to [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WikiDataiLib/).
