Today [Blazor WebAssembly 3.2.0 Preview 1 has been released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/blazor-webassembly-3-2-0-preview-1-release-now-available/).

So I decided to update my Blazor project.

Just followed tutorial above and it took 10 minutes.

So you need to do the following:

1. Replace package reference in your project to 3.2.0-preview1.20073.1
2. Do some modification in `Program.cs`.
3. Delete `Startup.cs'.
